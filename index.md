# `olin.build`

Olin.build facilitates and promotes student software projects at Olin College.

Projects hosted at the olin.build subdomain are known to have been created by
members of the community, but don't have the official weight or guarantees of
the college behind them. An olin.build project is at an intermediate trust level
and availability between `random-app.herokuapp.com` and
`official-site.olin.edu`.
