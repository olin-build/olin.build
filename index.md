# `olin.build`

Olin.build facilitates and promotes community software projects at the Olin
College of Engineering.

Projects hosted at the olin.build subdomain are known to have been created by
members of the community, but aren't official institutional projects. An
olin.build project is more trustworthy than a random app at
`some-random-name.herokuapp.com`, but does not have the security or availability
guarantees, or endorsement, of a project running at `official-site.olin.edu`.
